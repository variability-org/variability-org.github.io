	Mar 7, 2011<br><strong>Variability Outreach Director at UCSD Demonstrates OptIPortable Displays for Underserved Communities</strong><br>The UCSD outreach manager for the Variability Expedition recently demonstrated a new portable tiled display wall that will help UCSD undergrads to engage K-12 learners from underserved communities in southeast San Diego. “I didn't know what an OptIPortable was until a month ago and now I'm showing others how to use them,” says Naderi, who now leads the outreach program at UCSD for the Variability Expedition, an NSF-funded program that is exploring variability-aware software for efficient computing with nanoscale devices -- and is bringing hands-on experience with embedded systems and software to K-12 classrooms, especially in underserved communities. “This is proof of how user-friendly these devices are," she noted. It's one of several programs that Variability Expedition can use to excite young learners in science careers.

Variability Expedition co-PI Dennis Sylvester (University of Michigan) is one of the chip's creators. He is quoted saying that "the next big challenge is to achieve millmeter-scale systems, which have a host of new applications for monitoring our bodies, our environment and buildings. Because they're so small, you could manufacture hundreds of thousands on one wafer.
