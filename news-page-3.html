Colin Johnson reports in EETimes that a new wafer pruning technique developed at UCLA with funding from SRC is currently being characterized by IBM for its 45-nanometer process, using on-wafer monitoring structures that can be probed during fabrication to spot bad wafers early-on. UCLA's Puneet Gupta is quoted as saying 'wafer pruning ultimately leads to less expensive and higher performing electronics devices, especially if the pruning can be done during the early stages of manufacturing.'

The simulator can take arbitrary workloads, voltage schedules, etc. Both a Matlab and C++ versions have been released (see link). The researchers showed that in most cases, for long-lifetime systems (5 years+), the benefits of dynamic reliability management (dynamic voltage scaling, activity management with scheduling, power gating, etc.) are fairly limimted when compared to just traditional guardbanding approaches.
