<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/images/logo_nsf.jpg" border="0" width="199" height="201" style="float: right; border: 0; margin: 5px;" /><em>Three new $10 million awards continue NSF  program pursuing ambitious, fundamental research agendas that promise to define  the future of computing and information</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> Aug. 28, 2010 – The Directorate for Computer and Information  Science and Engineering (CISE) at the National Science Foundation (NSF)  announced three new Expeditions in Computing awards today. The awards will  provide up to $10 million in funding over five years to each of the selected  projects, representing the single largest investments made by the directorate  in basic computer science research.<br /> "There is a great deal of creativity in the computer  science research community today," said Deborah Crawford, acting assistant  director for CISE at NSF. "Our intentions with the Expeditions in Computing  program are to stimulate and use that creativity to expand the horizons of  computing," she said. "For example, several of the projects will be  exploring new computational approaches to some of the most vexing problems we  face in the science and engineering enterprise as well as in the larger society."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> The Expeditions in Computing program made its debut in 2008  with four awards. With funding appropriated to NSF in 2009 through the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the agency was able to support three new  trailblazer Expeditions. Today’s announcement brings the total number of  Expeditions projects currently receiving NSF support to ten. In the future, NSF  will make Expeditions awards following an 18-month cycle.<br /> Each  award features a top-notch team working on one of the most challenging computing  and information science and engineering issues today.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> <strong>Computational  Behavioral Science: Modeling, Analysis, and Visualization <br /> of Social and Communicative Behavior</strong><br /> <em><strong>Lead PI: James Rehg, Georgia Tech</strong></em><br /> <em><strong>Collaborators: USC, Boston University, UIUC,  CMU, MIT</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> It is well-known that the social and communicative behavior  of children as young as 12-24 months contains important clues about their risk  for a variety of developmental disorders, such as autism and Attention Deficit  Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Moreover, the ability to identify and treat such  disorders at an early age has been shown to significantly improve outcomes.  Autism represents a particularly compelling need in the US, since it affects one  child in 110 with a lifetime cost of care at $3.2 million per person. This Expeditions  project aims to develop novel techniques for measuring and analyzing the  behavior exhibited by children and adults during face-to-face social  interactions, including interactions between caregivers and children, children  playing and socializing in a daycare environment, and clinicians interacting  with children during individual therapy sessions. By developing methods to  automatically collect fine-grained behavioral data, this project will enable  large-scale objective screening and more effective therapy delivery and  assessment to those in need, including socio-economically disadvantaged populations.  More generally, this new computational technology will make it possible to  automatically measure the behavior of large numbers of individuals in a wide  range of settings over long periods of time. Other disciplines, such as  education, marketing, and customer relations, could benefit from a more  objective data-driven approach to behavioral assessment.  The long-term goal of this project is the  creation of a new scientific discipline of computational behavioral science,  which draws equally from computer science and psychology in order to transform  the study of human behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> <strong>Understanding Climate Change: A Data  Driven Approach<br /> <em>Lead PI: Vipin Kumar,  University of Minnesota </em></strong><br /> <em><strong>Collaborators: North Carolina A &amp; T  University, North Carolina State University, Northwestern University,  University of Tennessee/Oak Ridge National Laboratory</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> Climate  change is the defining environmental challenge now facing our planet. Yet there  is considerable uncertainty as to the wide-spread social and environmental  impacts because the predictive potential of numerical models is limited at the  scale of the entire earth system. Critical issues such as the impact of climate  change on food security, water resources, biodiversity, mortality, and other  socio-economic issues over relevant time and spatial scales have yet to be  addressed. This Expeditions project will generate new knowledge in climate  change science by developing novel and innovative data driven approaches that  take advantage of the wealth of climate and ecosystem data now available from various  sources around the globe. It will improve the prediction of climate change on  human welfare through the development of new methodologies in four broad areas  of data-intensive computer science: relationship mining, complex networks,  predictive modeling, and high performance computing. This research will be conducted in close  collaboration with the climate science community and will complement insights  obtained from physics-based climate models. The project will contribute to efforts  in education, diversity, community engagement, and the dissemination of new tools  and computer and atmospheric science findings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> <strong>Variability-Aware Software for  Efficient Computing with Nanoscale Devices</strong><br /> <em><strong>Lead PI: Rajesh Gupta, University of California,  San Diego </strong></em><br /> <em><strong>Collaborators: </strong></em><strong><em>Stanford, UC Irvine, UCLA,  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Michigan</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> As  semiconductor manufacturers build ever smaller circuits and chips, they become  less reliable and more expensive to produce – no longer behaving like precisely  chiseled machines with tight tolerances. Understanding the variability in their  behavior from device-to-device and over their lifetimes – due to manufacturing,  aging, and different operating environments – becomes increasingly critical.  This project fundamentally rethinks the hardware-software interface and  proposes a new class of computing machines that are not only adaptive but also  highly energy efficient. It envisions a computing system where components --  led by proactive software -- routinely monitor, predict and adapt to the  variability of the manufactured systems in which they are placed. These  machines will be able to discover the nature and extent of variation in  hardware, develop abstractions to capture these variations, and drive  adaptations in the software stack from compilers to runtime to applications.  The resulting computer systems will work while using components that vary in  performance or grow less reliable over time and across technology generations. A  fluid software-hardware interface will thus mitigate the variability of  manufactured systems and make machines robust, reliable and responsive to the  changing operating conditions. Changing the way software interacts with  hardware offers the best hope for perpetuating the fundamental gains of the  past 40 years in computing performance at a lower cost. In addition to plans  for involving graduate and undergraduate students in the research, the team has  built strong industrial ties and is committed to outreach to community high-school  students through a combination of tutoring and summer school programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Past Expeditions awards are beginning to show exciting  results in a variety of applications and fields," said Mitra Basu, program  director for the Expeditions program. "We’re confident that this latest group of  projects will continue to push the frontiers of computing."</p>
