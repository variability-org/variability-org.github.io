	Sep 11, 2015<br><strong>CAreDroid Systems Wins MobiCom Awards</strong><br>The CAreDroid system that UCLA professor Mani Srivastava's student Salma Elmalaki started under the Variability Expedition (but subsequently generalized to other forms of variations) with Lucas Wanner as a collaborator on operating system and programming language support for mobile application adaptation in response to variation of user context, hardware characteristics, and  operating conditions, won two awards at this year's ACM MobiCom: Best Paper Award and also the Best Community Paper Award, both for co-authors Elmalaki, Wanner and Srivastava. (The community award is given to the paper making the most contributions in terms of new data or hardware or software.)

Rahimi will present at the Design Automation Conference to be held in San Francisco this June. He is first author on the DAC paper, "Energy-Efficient GPGPU Architectures via Collaborative Compilation and Memristive Memory-Based Computing," co-authored with colleagues from UCSD, UC Santa Barbara and institutions in Italy and Switzerland.  Before that, in Dresden next month, Rahimi is first author on "Temporal Memoization for Energy-Efficient Timing Error Recovery in GPGPUs." Variability Expedition director Rajesh Gupta is senior on both papers, and will make the presentation at DATE. There are links to both paper on CSE's Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory (MESL) from the Publications section of the Variability website.<br><br>Jan 23, 2014<br><strong>Variability Papers at 19th Asia South Pacific DAC</strong><br>Two papers by Variability Expedition PIs were part of a special session with invited papers at the 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2014). It took place Jan. 21-23, 2014 in Singapore. The papers were: "Accurate and Inexpensive Performance Monitoring for Variability-Aware Systems," by Liangzhen Lai and Puneet Gupta (both UCLA); and "QED Post-Silicon Validation and Debug: Frequently Asked Questions," by David Lin and Subhasish Mitra (Stanford). Mitra organized the special session on overcoming silicon bottlenecks, focusing on variability, reliability, validation and debuggging. Other Expedition papers at ASP-DAC included one on "Rethinking Error Injection for Effective Resilience," co-authored by Mitra and Hyungmin Cho of Stanford, and collaborators from the University of Texas, Austin.[Link goes to conference abstracts.] [<a href='http://www.aspdac.com/aspdac2014/special_session/index.html#6S-1' target='_blank'>more</a>]<br><br>Oct 29, 2013<br><strong>NSF Variability Expedition Review and Joint Workshop</strong><br>Participants in the NSF Variability Expedition will meet Nov. 21-23 at UC Irvine for a review of Expedition interactions. The review is co-located as a Joint Workshop with a German Research Foundation (DFG) Priority Program 1500 workshop, which will take place on Saturday, Nov. 23. The German program is focused on "Design and Architectures of Dependable Embedded Systems - A Grand Challenge in the Nano Age," which was launched in 2009.

It's part of Embedded Systems Week 2013 in Montreal, Canada, and the Variability Expedition will be well-represented. On Oct. 2, three of the 13 papers involve Variability Expedition co-authors. In the morning, a UCLA-based team has a paper on "VarEMU: An Emulation Testbed for Variability-Aware Software," co-authored by Lucas Wanner, Salma Elmalaki, Liangzhen Lai, co-PI Puneet Gupta and Expedition deputy director Mani Srivastava. Then in the afternoon, UC Irvine Ph.D. student Majid Namaki-Shoushtari will present ARGO - "Aging-awaRe GPGPU Register File AllOcation," a joint paper with Abbas Rahimi, Nikil Dutt, Puneet Gupta and Rajesh Gupta. The same afternoon, Andrea Marongiu will present a paper on "A Variability-Aware OpenMP Environment for Efficient Execution of Accuracy-Configurable Computation on Shared-FPU Processor Clusters." The paper is joint among Marongiu and Luca Benini, both of the University of Bologna, and UCSD's Abbas Rahimi and Rajesh Gupta. [See Publications for advance PDFs of the latter two papers.] UCLA's Puneet Gupta is also giving a tutorial on the first morning of CODES+ISSS on "Cross‚ÄêLayer Reliability Modeling and Optimization for Embedded Systems under
Process Variations." Other speakers include Muhammad Shafique (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), as well as Hiren Patel and Siddharth Garg (both from the University of Waterloo).

He follows  this year's Program Chair, Rob Aitken of ARM, who sits on the Expedition's Advisory Board. ITC 2013 runs all this week in Anaheim, Calif., and Mitra will receive the IEEE Fellow Award. On Sept. 10, he will also chair the ever-popular "Elevator Talks" session, which this year includes a talk by fellow Variability co-PI Nikil Dutt of UC Irvine. Mitra also has two papers at ITC: one is on "Self-Repair of Uncore Components in Robust System-on-Chips: An OpenSPARC T2 Case Study," co-authored with Y. Li, E. Cheng and S. Marker. It demonstrates the practicality of the OpenSPARC T2 design. The other paper is "Early-Life Failure Detection Using SATbased ATPG," co-authored with researchers from the University of Freiburg (Germany) and Samsung Electronics.
